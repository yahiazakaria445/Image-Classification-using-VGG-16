# Overview
This project implements an image classification model using the VGG-16 architecture to classify images into 10 different animal categories.
The dataset can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10)

# Libraries used
- Os
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn 
- Cv2
- Datetime
- Tensorflow
- sklearn

# Data loading workflow
- A DataFrame consisting of two columns (filename, representing the image path, and class, representing the image label) was created, with each row corresponding to an image.
- The data was then split into training, validation, and test sets using the sklearn library with shuffling enabled.
- Each resulting DataFrame was passed to Kerasâ€™ ImageDataGenerator for reading images from disk in batches and applying real-time transformations.

# Model architecture
VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network that is 16 layers deep and a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.

# Used Callbacks
1. **ModelCheckpoint** : 
This function of keras callbacks is used to save the model after every epoch.

2. **EarlyStopping** : 
This function of Keras callbacks is used to stop the model training in between, used to stop the model as soon as it gets overfitted.

3. **Learning Rate Reduction** : 
This is a very simple function of callback that can be used to tweak the learning rate over a while, This gives us the desired output based on the respective epoch.

# Model explainability
 1- __Saliency maps__ : is an image that highlights the region on which people's eyes focus first.
